1. What are vulnerable and outdated components and How does it work:

- refers to software components that the developer is no longer supporting. This includes code that contains software vulnerabilities or is no longer maintained (code can be in the form of libraries or frameworks for web applications).

- They are identified by looking for components no longer supported by the vendor or with known security vulnerabilities. It is important to update and replace components to keep them secure as systems grow over time. 

2. Who is the attack usually carried out by:

- White/grey hat hackers - attempting to actually hack the system

- penetration testers - hired by the company to hack the system

Example: 

- An attack using vulnerability components was the Equifax data breach in 2017. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in apache struts a popular open-source framework used for development process

- The Ramsonware attack that affected thousands of computers worldwide in 2017, exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft windows that had been patched months before but was still present on many systems due to a lack of updates.

3. What issues/problems does it cause:

- data breaches

4. What mitigation exist:

- Maintain an inventory of components you are using and ensure they are up to date including the security patch 

- remove unused dependencies

- look for security patches for the components

- use continuous monitoring resources like common vulnerability and exposure
